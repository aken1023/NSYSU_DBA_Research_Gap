138,"During the learning process, a child develops a mental representation of the task he or she is learning. A Machine Learning algorithm develops also a latent representation of the task it learns. We investigate the development of the knowledge construction of an artificial agent through the analysis of its behavior, i.e., its sequences of moves while learning to perform the Tower of Hanoi (TOH) task. The TOH is a well-known task in experimental contexts to study the problem-solving processes and one of the fundamental processes of children's knowledge construction about their world. We position ourselves in the field of explainable reinforcement learning for developmental robotics, at the crossroads of cognitive modeling and explainable AI. Our main contribution proposes a 3-step methodology named Implicit Knowledge Extraction with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (IKE-XAI) to extract the implicit knowledge, in form of an automaton, encoded by an artificial agent during its learning. We showcase this technique to solve and explain the TOH task when researchers have only access to moves that represent observational behavior as in human-machine interaction. Therefore, to extract the agent acquired knowledge at different stages of its training, our approach combines: first, a Q-learning agent that learns to perform the TOH task; second, a trained recurrent neural network that encodes an implicit representation of the TOH task; and third, an XAI process using a post-hoc implicit rule extraction algorithm to extract finite state automata. We propose using graph representations as visual and explicit explanations of the behavior of the Q-learning agent. Our experiments show that the IKE-XAI approach helps understanding the development of the Q-learning agent behavior by providing a global explanation of its knowledge evolution during learning. IKE-XAI also allows researchers to identify the agent's Aha! moment by determining from what moment the knowledge representation stabilizes and the agent no longer learns. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

The framework has been expanded into several tracks during the last few years to meet the demands of different research directions. The agents are required either to play multiple unknown games with or without access to game simulations, or to design new game levels or rules.

This study investigated how the type of humor (self-deprecating or self-enhancing) that AI agents adopt interacted with the service context (hedonic-dominant or utilitarian-dominant) in influencing customers' intentions to continue using AI devices. Findings indicate that in hedonic-dominant service contexts, self-deprecating and self-enhancing humor increase continuous usage intention; in utilitarian-dominant service contexts, only self-deprecating humor boosts continuous usage intention. Results also reveal the mediating roles of positive emotion and inferred negative motives along with the moderating effect of anthropomorphism.

372,"In recent years, marketers have placed increased reliance upon artificial intelligence (AI) and, subsequently, the use of virtual agents in customer service contexts is on the rise. Despite such service digitalization, service can still fail. While there is an increasing literature on the effect of virtual agents in service settings, questions remain as to how customers react to service failure that results from interactions with virtual service agents. To this end, we deconstruct the effect of virtual agent service failure across two studies: one involving a process service failure and another involving an outcome service failure. We specifically manipulate the type of service agent that causes the service failure (human vs. virtual agent) and the magnitude of the failure (small vs. large). Results show that firms can leverage virtual service agents to mitigate or buffer the negative effects of service failure. From a managerial perspective, our findings suggest that firms could engage virtual service agents in situations where there may be a risk of outcome service failure-particularly in settings where relatively large magnitude failures may be experienced. In such a setting, we find that virtual service agents can mitigate the negative effects of service failure, more so than when the failure results from an interaction with a human service agent.",-0.1279761904761903,0.3732142857142858,負面

We unravel the complexity of this question by discussing examples within reinforcement learning and generative AI, and we examine how the puzzle of evaluating artificial agents' moral cognition remains open for further investigation within cognitive science.",-0.1305555555555555,0.5472222222222222,負面
385,"An Industrial Cyber-physical System (ICPS) provides a digital foundation for data-driven decision-making by artificial intelligence (AI) models. However, the poor data quality (e.g., inconsistent distribution, imbalanced classes) of high-speed, large-volume data streams poses significant challenges to the online deployment of offline-trained AI models. As an alternative, updating AI models online based on streaming data enables continuous improvement and resilient modeling performance. However, for a supervised learning model (i.e., a base learner), it is labor-intensive to annotate all streaming samples to update the model. Hence, a data acquisition method is needed to select the data for annotation to ensure data quality while saving annotation efforts. In the literature, active learning methods have been proposed to acquire informative samples. Different acquisition criteria were developed for exploration of under-represented regions in the input variable space or exploitation of the well-represented regions for optimal estimation of base learners. However, it remains a challenge to balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off under different online annotation scenarios. On the other hand, an acquisition criterion learned by AI adapts itself to a scenario dynamically, but the ambiguous consideration of the trade-off limits its performance in frequently changing manufacturing contexts. To overcome these limitations, we propose an ensemble active learning method by contextual bandits (CbeAL). CbeAL incorporates a set of active learning agents (i.e., acquisition criteria) explicitly designed for exploration or exploitation by a weighted combination of their acquisition decisions. The weight of each agent will be dynamically adjusted based on the usefulness of its decisions to improve the performance of the base learner. With adaptive and explicit consideration of both objectives, CbeAL efficiently guides the data acquisition process by selecting informative samples to reduce the human annotation efforts. Furthermore, we characterize the exploration and exploitation capability of the proposed agents theoretically. The evaluation results in a numerical simulation study and a real case study demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of CbeAL in manufacturing process modeling of the ICPS.",-0.1749999999999999,0.5527777777777777,負面

This paper presents the theory behind a novel agent based AGV controller that aims to control the flow of AGVs in an effective manner and, therefore, overcome the inefficiencies that can be found in complex designs. Agents are simple entities that interact with other agents to produce an emergent behaviour that is not explicitly programmed into them. The AGV controller presented uses agents as traffic managers to allow access to points and segments in the guide path. Each agent has a rule base that it uses to assess the enquiries that it receives from an AGV. Each enquiry is evaluated only at the smallest possible part of the guide path rather than the entire guide path. AGVs are then able to allocate segments and points on their paths depending on the result of each enquiry.

561,"Virtue ethics seems to be a promising moral theory for understanding and interpreting the development and behavior of artificial moral agents. Virtuous artificial agents would blur traditional distinctions between different sorts of moral machines and could make a claim to membership in the moral community. Accordingly, we investigate the ""machine question"" by studying whether virtue or vice can be attributed to artificial intelligence; that is, are people willing to judge machines as possessing moral character? An experiment describes situations where either human or AI agents engage in virtuous or vicious behavior and experiment participants then judge their level of virtue or vice. The scenarios represent different virtue ethics domains of truth, justice, fear, wealth, and honor. Quantitative and qualitative analyses show that moral attributions are weakened for AIs compared to humans, and the reasoning and explanations for the attributions are varied and more complex. On ""relational"" views of membership in the moral community, virtuous machines would indeed be included, even if they are indeed weakened. Hence, while our moral relationships with artificial agents may be of the same types, they may yet remain substantively different than our relationships to human beings.",-0.1145833333333333,0.5010416666666666,負面

680,"Behavior Trees (BTs) were invented as a tool to enable modular AI in computer games, but have received an increasing amount of attention in the robotics community in the last decade. With rising demands on agent AI complexity, game programmers found that the Finite State Machines (FSM) that they used scaled poorly and were difficult to extend, adapt and reuse. In BTs, the state transition logic is not dispersed across the individual states, but organized in a hierarchical tree structure, with the states as leaves. This has a significant effect on modularity, which in turn simplifies both synthesis and analysis by humans and algorithms alike. These advantages are needed not only in game AI design, but also in robotics, as is evident from the research being done.

717,"In the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics, the term ""autonomy"" is generally used to mean the capacity of an artificial agent to operate independently of human guidance. It is thereby assumed that the agent has a fixed goal or ""utility function"" with respect to which the appropriateness of its actions will be evaluated. From a philosophical perspective, this notion of autonomy seems oddly weak. For, in philosophy, the term is generally used to refer to a stronger capacity, namely the capacity to ""give oneself the law,"" to decide by oneself what one's goal or principle of action will be. The predominant view in the literature on the long-term prospects and risks of artificial intelligence is that an artificial agent cannot exhibit such autonomy because it cannot rationally change its own final goal, since changing the final goal is counterproductive with respect to that goal and hence undesirable. The aim of this paper is to challenge this view by showing that it is based on questionable assumptions about the nature of goals and values. I argue that a general AI may very well come to modify its final goal in the course of developing its understanding of the world.

854,"We developed a method to synthesize game levels that accounts for the degree of collaboration required by two players to finish a given game level. We first asked a game level designer to create playable game level chunks. Then, two artificial intelligence (AI) virtual agents driven by behavior trees played each game level chunk. We recorded the degree of collaboration required to accomplish each game level chunk by the AI virtual agents and used it to characterize each game level chunk. To synthesize a game level, we assigned to the total cost function cost terms that encode both the degree of collaboration and game level design decisions. Then, we used a Markov-chain Monte Carlo optimization method, called simulated annealing, to solve the total cost function and proposed a design for a game level. We synthesized three game levels (low, medium, and high degrees of collaboration game levels) to evaluate our implementation. We then recruited groups of participants to play the game levels to explore whether they would experience a certain degree of collaboration and validate whether the AI virtual agents provided sufficient data that described the collaborative behavior of players in each game level chunk. By collecting both in-game objective measurements and self-reported subjective ratings, we found that the three game levels indeed impacted the collaboration gameplay behavior of our participants. Moreover, by analyzing our collected data, we found moderate and strong correlations between the participants and the AI virtual agents.

We argue that such a renouncement opens interesting ways to explore the possibilities for designing artificial agents with intrinsic motivations and constitutive autonomy.

When the interaction cycle is inverted, input data are not percepts directly received from the environment, but outcomes of control loops.

Methods: HCT116 colorectal cancer cells and FHs 74 Int intestinal cells were treated with CBK, followed by determination of cell proliferation with 3-(4,5-dimethyfthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities as well as protein expressions of Bcl-2 and BAX, and mRNA levels of caspase-9, caspase-3, Bcl-2 and BAX in HCT116 cells were evaluated, followed by examination of the morphological alterations of HCT116 cells with Hoechst 33342 staining.

1080,"Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to transform firm-customer interactions. However, current AI marketing agents are often perceived as cold and uncaring and can be poor substitutes for human-based interactions. Addressing this issue, this article argues that artificial empathy needs to become an important design consideration in the next generation of AI marketing applications. Drawing from research in diverse disciplines, we develop a systematic framework for integrating artificial empathy into AI-enabled marketing interactions. We elaborate on the key components of artificial empathy and how each component can be implemented in AI marketing agents. We further explicate and test how artificial empathy generates value for both customers and firms by bridging the AI-human gap in affective and social customer experience. Recognizing that artificial empathy may not always be desirable or relevant, we identify the requirements for artificial empathy to create value and deduce situations where it is unnecessary and, in some cases, harmful.",-0.237037037037037,0.7981481481481482,負面
1155,"In this article, we present an approach to generate a team of general video game playing agents with differentiated behaviors that can ultimately assist in the game development process. We consider the agent behavior as the corresponding outcomes of playing the game: rate of wins, score, exploration, enemies killed, items collected, etc. We create and identify agents that are expected to achieve particular goals but do not necessarily simulate human behavior during gameplay. We present a solution that, by heuristic diversification, provides a controller with different heuristics and a corresponding set of weights, driving its actions. Given the simplicity of this behavior-encoding and its easiness to evolve, we use Multidimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites to generate different solutions that elicit particular behaviors and assemble a team. The resulting agents are allocated in a feature space, used to identify the expectations of each of them. We generate a team for four games of the General Video Game Artificial Intelligence framework and find six different behavior-type agents in each. We include an experiment to check the portability of these agents when playing alternative levels and an exploratory work aiming to use them to detect design flaws in game levels.",-0.1031746031746031,0.4365079365079364,負面
1198,"Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) create an increasing similarity between the performance of AI systems or AI-based robots and human communication. They raise the questions: (1) whether it is possible to communicate with, understand, and even empathically perceive artificial agents; (2) whether we should ascribe actual subjectivity and thus quasi-personal status to them beyond a certain level of simulation; (3) what will be the impact of an increasing dissolution of the distinction between simulated and real encounters. (1) To answer these questions, the paper argues that the precondition for actually understanding others consists in the implicit assumption of the subjectivity of our counterpart, which makes shared feelings and a ""we-intentionality"" possible. This assumption is ultimately based on the presupposition of a shared form of life, conceived here as ""conviviality."" (2) The possibility that future artificial agents could meet these preconditions is refuted on the basis of embodied and enactive cognition, which links subjectivity and consciousness to the aliveness of an organism. (3) Even if subjectivity is in principle impossible for artificial agents, the distinction between simulated and real subjectivity might nevertheless become increasingly blurred. Here, possible consequences are discussed, especially using the example of virtual psychotherapy. Finally, the paper makes case for a mindful appproach to the language we use to talk about artificial systems and pleads for preventing a systematic pretense of subjectivity.",-0.1901190476190476,0.7298214285714286,負面

A Self-Organizing Map (SOM) clustering technique was also employed to find homogeneous extracted sub-series' clusters. As a complementary feature, extraction criterion of mutual information (MI) was utilized for proper cluster agent choice to impose to the artificial intelligence (AI) models (Feed Forward Neural Network, FFNN; Extreme Learning Machine, ELM; and Least Square Support Vector Machine, LSSVM) to predict the runoff of the LRW sub-basins. The performance of wavelet-based runoff prediction was compared to the Markovian-based MS model. The proposed method not only considers the prediction of the outlet runoff but also covers predictions of interior sub-basins behavior. The outcomes showed that the proposed AI-models combined with the SOM and MI tools enhanced the MS runoff prediction efficiency up to 23% in comparison with the Markovian-based models. Nevertheless, benefit of the seasonality of the process along with reduction of dimension of the inputs could help the AI-models to consume pure information of the recorded data.",-0.1426020408163265,0.6428571428571429,負面
1285,"This study examines the plausibility of the emergence of sunspot equilibria in an agent-based artificial stock market. Using the agent-based model, we make the sunspots explicit so that we can test, e. g., by means of the Granger causality test, whether purely extrinsic uncertainty can influence price dynamics. In addition, through agent-based simulation, the coordination process, which is mainly driven by genetic programming, becomes observable, which enables us to analyze what agents perceive and whether they believe in sunspots. By manipulating different control variables, three series of experiments are conducted. Generally speaking, the chances of observing ""sunspot equilibria"" in this agent-based artificial stock market are small. However, the sunspot believers can never be driven out of the market. Nevertheless, they are always outnumbered by fundamental believers, which is evidence that the market as collective behavior is rational. We also find that lengthening the time horizon will make it difficult for sunspot believers to survive.",-0.1898809523809523,0.6666666666666666,負面
1345,"This paper offers a novel perspective on trust in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, focusing on the transfer of user trust in AI creators to trust in AI systems. Using the agentic information systems (IS) framework, we investigate the role of AI alignment and steerability in trust transference. Through four randomized experiments, we probe three key alignment-related attributes of AI systems: creator-based steerability, user-based steerability, and autonomy. Results indicate that creator-based steerability amplifies trust transference from AI creator to AI system, while user-based steerability and autonomy diminish it. Our findings suggest that AI alignment efforts should consider the entity with which the AI goals and values should be aligned and highlight the need for research to theorize from a triadic view encompassing the user, the AI system, and its creator. Given the diversity in individual goals and values, we recommend that developers move beyond the prevailing ""one-size-fits-all"" alignment strategy.

However, the use of urban network security games to analyze the problem of catching criminals at road checkpoints is difficult, which has hindered their application to city-scale networks. To overcome this difficulty, we have developed min-cut arrangement and graph contraction algorithms. The min-cut arrangement algorithm identifies candidate checkpoint locations that maximize security. The graph contraction algorithm reduces the problem, leading to a dramatic reduction in computational time for urban network security games, for which the computational cost increases exponentially with the size of the problem.

1548,"In this article, we present a new methodology that employs tester agents to automate video game testing. We introduce two types of agents-synthetic and humanlike-and two distinct approaches to create them. Our agents are derived from Sarsa and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) but focus on finding defects, while traditional game-playing agents focus on maximizing game scores. The synthetic agent uses test goals generated from game scenarios, and these goals are further modified to examine the effects of unintended game transitions. The humanlike agent uses test goals extracted by our proposed multiple greedy-policy inverse reinforcement learning (MGP-IRL) algorithm from tester trajectories. MGP-IRL captures multiple policies executed by human testers. We use our agents to produce test sequences, and run the game with these sequences. At each run, we use an automated test oracle to check for bugs. We analyze the proposed method in two parts-we compare the success of humanlike and synthetic agents in bug finding, and we evaluate the similarity between humanlike agents and human testers. We collected 427 trajectories from human testers using the General Video Game Artificial Intelligence (GVG-AI) framework and created three games with 12 levels that contain 45 bugs.

Semen was collected from Yakido roosters, and pooled semen was diluted 1: 1 using semen diluent containing no cryoprotective agent. After equilibration at 5 degrees C for 30 min, diluted semen was further diluted 1: 1 using semen diluent containing MA at a final concentration of 9%. Diluted semen was packaged into 0.5-mL plastic straws and frozen by placing the straws in liquid nitrogen vapor followed by plunging into liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees C. After storage in liquid nitrogen for about one month, frozen semen was thawed in ice water. Intravaginal artificial insemination (AI) was performed immediately after thawing semen without removing the cryoprotective agent. In Fertility Trial 1, AI was performed once a week for four consecutive weeks. Weekly fertility rates using frozen semen were 83.8+/-13.8%, 77.1+/-8.8%, 88.6+/-15.1%, and 77.3+/-5.7% for weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

The effect of crude extracellular extracts of PO212 on the soil-borne pathogenFusarium oxysporumf. sp.lycopersicihas been evaluated. Evidence of the involvement of soluble, thermo-labile, and proteinase-inactivated macromolecules present in PO212 crude extracts in the control ofFusariumvascular disease in tomato plants was found. Proteomic techniques and the availability of the access to the PO212 genome database have allowed the identification of glycosyl hydrolases, oxidases, and peptidases in these extracellular extracts. Furthermore, a bioassay-guided fractionation of PO212 crude extracellular extracts using an integrated membrane/solid phase extraction process was set up. This method enabled the separation of a PO212 crude extracellular extract of seven days of growth into four fractions of different molecular sizes and polarities: high molecular mass protein fraction >5 kDa, middle molecular mass protein fraction 5-1 kDa, low molecular mass metabolite fraction, and nutrients from culture medium (mainly glucose and minerals). The high and middle molecular mass protein fractions retained disease control activity in a way similar to that of the control extracts. Proteomic techniques have allowed the identification of nine putatively secreted proteins in the high molecular mass protein fraction matching those identified in the total crude extracts. Therefore, these enzymes are considered to be potentially responsible of the crude extracellular extract-induced resistance in tomato plants againstF. oxysporumf. sp.lycopersici.

The algorithms are completely decentralized, allowing efficient parallelization and applications where the agents may have different behavior policies and different initial state distributions while evaluating a common target policy. It is proved under nonrestrictive assumptions that the proposed algorithms weakly converge to the solutions of the mean ordinary differential equation (ODE) common for all the agents. It is also proved that the whole system may be stabilized by a proper choice of the network and that the parameter estimates weakly converge to consensus. Discussion is given on the asymptotic bias and variance of the estimates, on the projected forms of the proposed algorithms, as well as on restrictiveness of the adopted assumptions.

2524,"To assess the intelligence of machines, Alan Turing proposed a test of imitation known as the imitation game, famously known as the Turing test. To assess whether artificial intelligent (AI) systems could be moral or not, Colin Allen et al. developed a test of imitation in the context of morality, a test known as the Moral Turing Test (MTT), which I will, in this paper, call the moral imitation game. There are arguments against developing any type of MTT or moral imitation game. Rather than developing a moral imitation game, this paper proposes a criterion of imitation for AI systems in the moral scenario. To develop a criterion of imitation, I explore the notion of moral attribution in detail. Within the case of moral attribution, I introduce the subject-ascriber distinction. The notion of moral attribution and the subject-ascriber distinction is employed to address the following questions: (a) how is the assessment in MTT arranged?, (b) what is the role of the interrogator in the MTT?, and (c) what information is to be concealed from the interrogator? The first question deals with the aspect of assessment, the second question deals with the reordering of the role of the interrogator and the third one deals with the concealment aspect of the imitation game. After that, a criterion of imitation for AI systems is put forward.

BRhB can not only be dissolved in the acid deposition solution due to its amidocyanogen substitute, where HCl was added to suppress hydrolysis of SnCl2, but also be adsorbed on the surface of SnO2 through its carbonate substitute. Therefore, it was used as a structure-directing agent to control the growth of SnO2 crystals and then the crystalline structure and surface morphology of the deposited film. The electrodeposited thin films show porous morphology and rutile-type SnO2 crystalline structure due to the effects of BRhB on the growth, and these structural features can be adjusted by changing the added amount of BRhB. The SnO2 thin film electrodeposited with addition of BRhB exhibits electrocatalytic characteristic enhancement on oxidation of phenol due to its porous structure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

2588,"An important challenge for safety in machine learning and artificial intelligence systems is a set of related failures involving specification gaming, reward hacking, fragility to distributional shifts, and Goodhart's or Campbell's law. This paper presents additional failure modes for interactions within multi-agent systems that are closely related. These multi-agent failure modes are more complex, more problematic, and less well understood than the single-agent case, and are also already occurring, largely unnoticed. After motivating the discussion with examples from poker-playing artificial intelligence (AI), the paper explains why these failure modes are in some senses unavoidable. Following this, the paper categorizes failure modes, provides definitions, and cites examples for each of the modes: accidental steering, coordination failures, adversarial misalignment, input spoofing and filtering, and goal co-option or direct hacking. The paper then discusses how extant literature on multi-agent AI fails to address these failure modes, and identifies work which may be useful for the mitigation of these failure modes.",-0.1233333333333333,0.4233333333333333,負面

The mechanisms by which the bacterium is transmitted from vector to host are poorly understood. In this study, we show that the F(ab)(2) fragments of BBE31, a B. burgdorferi outer-surface lipoprotein, interfere with the migration of the spirochete from tick gut into the hemolymph during tick feeding. The decreased hemolymph infection results in lower salivary glands infection, and consequently attenuates mouse infection by tick-transmitted B. burgdorferi. Using a yeast surface display approach, a tick gut protein named TRE31 was identified to interact with BBE31. Silencing tre31 also decreased the B. burgdorferi burden in the tick hemolymph.

2892,"To investigate the in vivo effects of macromolecular crowding we examined the effect of inert macromolecules such as polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene glycol on the in vitro activity of recA protein. The addition of either of these volume-occupying agents enables recA protein to promote homologous pairing and exchange of DNA strands at an otherwise nonpermissive magnesium ion concentration. In the presence of these macromolecules, both the rate of recA protein association with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and the steady-state affinity of recA protein for ssDNA are increased. Consequently, the ability of recA protein to compete with ssDNA-binding protein (SSB protein) is enhanced, and the inhibitory effects of SSB protein on the formation of recA protein-ssDNA presynaptic complexes are eliminated. Because the ability of recA protein to bind to ssDNA-containing secondary structures is also enhanced in volume-occupied solution, joint molecule formation is not greatly reduced when SSB protein is omitted from the reaction. Thus, increased recA protein interactions with ssDNA contribute to enhanced presynaptic complex formation. In addition, polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene glycol must also affect another property of recA protein, i.e. self-association, which is required for synapsis and DNA strand exchange. Our examination of DNA strand exchange in the presence of volume-occupying agents helps to reconcile the requirement for elevated magnesium ion concentrations in recA protein-promoted recombination reactions in vitro, with a presumably low magnesium ion concentration in vivo.",-0.2,0.45,負面

3736,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved superhuman performance in board games such as Go, chess, and Othello (Reversi). In other words, the AI system surpasses the level of a strong human expert player in such games. In this context, it is difficult for a human player to enjoy playing the games with the AI. To keep human players entertained and immersed in a game, the AI is required to dynamically balance its skill with that of the human player. To address this issue, we propose AlphaDDA, an AlphaZero-based AI with dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA). AlphaDDA consists of a deep neural network (DNN) and a Monte Carlo tree search, as in AlphaZero. AlphaDDA learns and plays a game the same way as AlphaZero, but can change its skills. AlphaDDA estimates the value of the game state from only the board state using the DNN. AlphaDDA changes a parameter dominantly controlling its skills according to the estimated value. Consequently, AlphaDDA adjusts its skills according to a game state. AlphaDDA can adjust its skill using only the state of a game without any prior knowledge regarding an opponent. In this study, AlphaDDA plays Connect4, Othello, and 6x6 Othello with other AI agents. Other AI agents are AlphaZero, Monte Carlo tree search, the minimax algorithm, and a random player. This study shows that AlphaDDA can balance its skill with that of the other AI agents, except for a random player. AlphaDDA can weaken itself according to the estimated value.

The DDA ability of AlphaDDA is based on an accurate estimation of the value from the state of a game.

However, the majority of current approaches lead to predefined, static and predictable game agent responses, with no ability to adjust during game-play to the behaviour or playing style of the player. Machine learning techniques provide a way to improve the behavioural dynamics of computer controlled game agents by facilitating the automated generation and selection of behaviours, thus enhancing the capabilities of digital game artificial intelligence and providing the opportunity to create more engaging and entertaining game-play experiences.

In this research, we seek to understand the trust formation between humans and artificial agents from the morality and uncanny theory perspective. We conducted three studies to carefully examine the effect of two moral foundations: perceptions of harm and perceptions of injustice, as well as reported wrongdoing on uncanniness and examine the effect of uncanniness on trust in artificial agents. In Study 1, we found perceived injustice was the primary determinant of uncanniness and uncanniness had a negative effect on trust. Studies 2 and 3 extended these findings using two different scenarios of wrongful acts involving an artificial agent. In addition to explaining the contribution of moral appraisals to the feeling of uncanny, the latter studies also uncover substantial contributions of both perceived harm and perceived injustice.

The problem of interaction between multiple problem solving agents is complex and has led to the genesis of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI). In this paper, some of the fundamental issues, motivations and problems of distributed AI are discussed.

4234,"Purpose To establish and validate a universal artificial intelligence (AI) platform for collaborative management of cataracts involving multilevel clinical scenarios and explored an AI-based medical referral pattern to improve collaborative efficiency and resource coverage. Methods The training and validation datasets were derived from the Chinese Medical Alliance for Artificial Intelligence, covering multilevel healthcare facilities and capture modes. The datasets were labelled using a three-step strategy: (1) capture mode recognition; (2) cataract diagnosis as a normal lens, cataract or a postoperative eye and (3) detection of referable cataracts with respect to aetiology and severity. Moreover, we integrated the cataract AI agent with a real-world multilevel referral pattern involving self-monitoring at home, primary healthcare and specialised hospital services. Results The universal AI platform and multilevel collaborative pattern showed robust diagnostic performance in three-step tasks: (1) capture mode recognition (area under the curve (AUC) 99.28%-99.71%), (2) cataract diagnosis (normal lens, cataract or postoperative eye with AUCs of 99.82%, 99.96% and 99.93% for mydriatic-slit lamp mode and AUCs >99% for other capture modes) and (3) detection of referable cataracts (AUCs >91% in all tests). In the real-world tertiary referral pattern, the agent suggested 30.3% of people be 'referred', substantially increasing the ophthalmologist-to-population service ratio by 10.2-fold compared with the traditional pattern. Conclusions The universal AI platform and multilevel collaborative pattern showed robust diagnostic performance and effective service for cataracts.

4238,"This study investigated whether a drug therapy-induced reduction in nocturnal blood pressure (BP) was associated with decreased sleep apnea activity. Two polysomnographies from 54 hospitalized male hypertensive, obstructive sleep apnea patients were analyzed in a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trial of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril (C), 2.5 mg once daily, or placebo (P). Blood pressure was measured by means of an intra-arterial catheter. Compared with P, C lowered mean arterial BP during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) (-8.3 +/- 10.7 mm Hg, P =.05) and REM sleep (-8.6 +/- 10.1 mn Hg, P =.02). Respiratory disturbance index (-8.6 +/- 3.2 events/h of sleep (n/h), P =.01) and apnea index (AI) (-6.6 +/- 3.0 n/h, P =.04) during NREM sleep were lowered by C and, to a lesser extent, by P (-5.9 +/- 3.2 n/h, P =.07 and -5.0 +/- 3.6 n/h, P =.18, respectively). The effect on AI and hypopnea index (KI) during REM sleep was not significant for C (-5.9 +/- 3.4 and 0.1 +/- 2.0, NS, respectively) and P (-2.6 +/- 3.9 and 1.6 +/- 2.0, NS, respectively). There was a significant linear correlation between the change in REM systolic BP and the change in REM Al (r = 0.28, P =.04); the mean BP change correlated negatively with the change in HI (-0.28, P =,04). During NREM sleep there was no significant correlation between changes in BP and the treatment effects on sleep apnea activity. Blood pressure reduction after short-term antihypertensive treatment did not affect sleep disordered breathing during NREM sleep. Reduced BP was associated with a weak reduction of AI and a slight increase of HI during REM sleep. It appears that elevated BP contributes only marginally to sleep apnea severity in hypertensive patients with obstructive sleep apnea.

Evidence is mounting that coinfections caused by multiple pathogens are common in nature and can alter the severity of diseases in marine animals. However, bacterial coinfections involving V. harveyi have received little attention in mariculture. In this study, the results of pathogen isolation indicated that bacterial coinfection was a common and overlooked risk for hybrid groupers (female Epinephelus polyphekadion x male E. fuscoguttatus) reared in an industrialized flow-through pattern in Hainan Province. The artificial infection in hybrid groupers revealed that coinfections with V. harveyi strain GDH11385 (a serious lethal causative agent to groupers) and other isolated pathogens resulted in higher mortality (46.67%) than infection with strain GDH11385 alone (33.33%), whereas no mortality was observed in single infection with other pathogens. Furthermore, the intestine, liver and spleen of hybrid groupers are target organs for bacterial coinfections involving V. harveyi. Based on the infection patterns found in this study, we propose that V. harveyi may have a specific spatiotemporal expression pattern of virulence genes when infecting the host. Taken together, bacterial coinfection with V. harveyi is a neglected high-risk lethal causative agent to hybrid groupers in the industrialized flow-through aquaculture systems in Hainan Province.",-0.1083730158730158,0.4126190476190476,負面

This assessment was performed for image registration of treatment planning computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with Primovist (R) contrast agent acquired post stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). SBRT treatment planning CT scans and posttreatment Primovist (R) MRI scans were obtained for 14 patients. The liver was delineated on both sets of images and matching anatomical landmarks were chosen by a radiation oncologist. Rigid registration, DIR, and two types of SG-DIR (using liver contours only; and using liver structures along with anatomical landmarks) were performed for each set of scans. TG-132 recommended metrics were estimated which included Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Mean Distance to Agreement (MDA), Target Registration Error (TRE), and Jacobian determinant. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. The median (range) DSC for rigid registration was 0.88 (0.77-0.89), 0.89 (0.81-0.93) for DIR, and 0.90 (0.86-0.94) for both types of SG-DIR tested in this study. The median MDA was 4.8 mm (3.7-6.8 mm) for rigid registration, 3.4 mm (2.4-8.7 mm) for DIR, 3.2 mm (2.0-5.2 mm) for SG-DIR where liver structures were used to guide the registration, and 2.8 mm (2.1-4.2 mm) for the SG-DIR where liver structures and anatomical landmarks were used to guide the registration. The median TRE for rigid registration was 7.2 mm (0.5-23 mm), 6.8 mm (0.7-30.7 mm) for DIR, 6.1 mm (1.1-20.5 mm) for the SG-DIR guided by only the liver structures, and 4.1 mm (0.8-19.7 mm) for SG-DIR guided by liver contours and anatomical landmarks. The SG-DIR shows higher liver conformality as per TG-132 metrics and lowest TRE compared to rigid registration and DIR in Velocity AI software for the purpose of registering treatment planning CT and post-SBRT MRI for the liver region.

4927,"Platelets play a critical role in blood clotting and the development of arterial blockages. Antiplatelet therapy is vital for preventing recurring events in conditions like coronary artery disease and strokes. However, there is a lack of comprehensive guidelines for using antiplatelet agents in elective neurosurgery. Continuing therapy during surgery poses a bleeding risk, while discontinuing it before surgery increases the risk of thrombosis. Discontinuation is recommended in neurosurgical settings but carries an elevated risk of ischemic events. Conversely, maintaining antithrombotic therapy may increase bleeding and the need for transfusions, leading to a poor prognosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise in making difficult decisions regarding antiplatelet therapy. This paper discusses current clinical guidelines and supported regimens for antiplatelet therapy in neurosurgery. It also explores methodologies like P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) monitoring and thromboelastography (TEG) mapping for monitoring the use of antiplatelet regimens as well as their limitations. The paper explores the potential of AI to overcome such limitations associated with PRU monitoring and TEG mapping. It highlights various studies in the field of cardiovascular and neuroendovascular surgery which use AI prediction models to forecast adverse outcomes such as ischemia and bleeding, offering assistance in decision-making for antiplatelet therapy. In addition, the use of AI to improve patient adherence to antiplatelet regimens is also considered.
